'getDeclaredMethods()' will give the list of only those method(including 'private','protected' and 'default' methods) which are 
persent in the current class.It does not give the list of the methods inherited from parent class or interface.


On the other hand 'getMethods()' will give the list of ALL the PUBLIC methods(including the methods which are inherited from 
parent class or interfaces.).BUT it does not give the list of 'private','protected' and 'default' methods.
